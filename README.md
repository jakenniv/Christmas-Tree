# Christmas-Tree

This is a little applet I've been working on in light of the Christmas season. I started out knowing nothing about Swing programming 
and taught myself everything I needed to know in order to achieve this result. 

So far, this applet will display a Christmas tree and present a few options: you can add a star, add some ornaments, or create
a sweet disco tree by changing all the colors. I'm still working on optimizing the code, but this is the first commit. 

All of this is my own work. 

Enjoy!
